<h3>OSM Tools</h3>
<h4>An OpenStreetMap Toolkit for Python</h4>
<p>
OSMTools is a small set of Python tools for retrieving and using OpenStreetMap (OSM) images. Its original application was to draw a bunch of bus icons moving around on the map, which has been somewhat generalized.
</p>
<p>
With OSMTools you can:
<ul>
<li>Grab appropriate rendered OSM tiles from an OSM server
<li>Patch tiles together into a bigger map
<li>Easily animate stuff on that map (requires pygame)
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Using OSM Tools</h4>
The code below will show a train traveling the USA. Choo choo!
<code>
 start_lat,start_lon = (45.77,-68.65)
 end_lat,end_lon = (30.05,-118.25)
 begin_time, end_time = 0, 60
 
 def locAtTime(t): #basic interpolation helper
   if t &lt 0: return start_lat,start_lon
   if t &gt 0:
